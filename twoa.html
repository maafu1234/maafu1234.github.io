<h1>Three Website Opinion Article<h1>
	<p>I am going to be explaining about why I like two great websites and why I don't like a not-so great website</p>
	
<h2><a href="https://www.carroll.edu/">Carroll College</a></h2>
<p>I specifically like that Carroll's web page has so much information on it's site. You can find anything you need and is really easy to navigate through. I like that it caters to all different types of people such as, teachers, students, future students, etc.
   I think that their layout is very easy to understand and know where you want to go. I like that it has tons of information and even tabs for future students. The rolling pictures really attracts the reader's eyes, also makes them
   curious about what the school is about. What really makes this website stand out is the dates on the bottom of the screen showing the upcoming dates so not only students come but people in the community as well. Another neat little thing that they have on their website is 
   is the accomplishments that the school has done academically and through sports as well.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.eliteutraining.com/">Elite U</a></h2>
<p>This is my trainer's business that I use to train for the football season when I'm back home. I personally really like the colors on his website. I don't really like that his website is so simple.  I like that it is so dark and then in the middle of the page is a big
white logo.This really captures the attention of the visitor to the site. I believe that he did this so that the logo will be engraved into the persons brain so that they remember his brand and hopefully give him business.
He could however use more colors help the website become less boring. He could make the category light up when you hover over the option. This could add some extra pizzazz. I also don't think that he 
used any categories on this website. I do believe that he did use HTML5 elements however it looks very basic. You can navigate around it pretty well but there isn't much there to navigate. There is also a trainers page that 
isn't built yet and just says that "trainers page under construction". There is no borders around the titles on the pages which I think could make it look more professional. It is also confusing why it goes to a different website
when you click on the category of "perform better equipment", I personally find this pretty annoying. The main colors on this website are black and white. Overall I think that he used the colors efficiently the black background and white lettering, 
though basic,is a classic/clean look. I believe that the things that negatively set it apart is just the simple and boringness of it. He could of made the images especially on the home page stand out 
more, instead of it just looking like you just pasted it on there like a word document. The biggest reason I don't like this website is the fact that it looks like something I could do "which is not a compliment". </p>

<h3><a href="https://leg.mt.gov/">Montana Legislature</a></h3>
 <p>I really like Southwest's website because I find that is very easy to use. I also like the colorfulness of the site. This colorfulness is the thing that sets it apart from other airline websites in my opinion. The blue 
 lettering they use looks very good on the website. They use the blue color that is the same color as their planes, this is a very good strategy. The main colors they use are blue, red. and yellow. There is a scrolling effect 
 and it is a good layout in my opinion. The layout is with the book the flight finder is right in the middle of the main page. They did this in my opinion so that customers can just search southwest.com and go right to the place 
where they can book a flight and chose their destination of choice without any extra clicking and searching for the page where it is. This layout is very straight to the point because really what else are you going to an airline's
website other than to book a flight. It is very easy to navigate. There is some tables at the bottom of the home page that talk about things like about southwest, their products and etc. The color they use is very effective because
the red, blue, and yellow look good together and look good with the white space they use. They also have a good use of graphics on the site. They use modern HTML elements on their site. They have categories you can click on that 
lead you to another page and light up when you hover over it with your mouse. Overall I think that it is a very professional and well-put together website.
